**Testing Procedure:**
1. Racket placed in sealed bag/chamber for 15 minutes
2. VOC detector probe inserted
3. Reading taken after 30 seconds
4. Measurement in parts per million (ppm)

**Acceptable Limits:**
- Maximum VOC reading: 50 ppm
- Any reading above 50 ppm = illegal racket
- Borderline readings (45-55 ppm) may be retested
- Consistent high readings may indicate boosting

**Penalties for VOC Violations:**
- First offense: Warning + racket confiscation
- Second offense: Suspension from event
- Third offense: Long-term suspension + fine
- Intentional boosting: Disqualification + ranking penalties

**When Racket Control Conducted:**
- All players at World Championships
